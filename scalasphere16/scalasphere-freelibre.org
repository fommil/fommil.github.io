- ENSIME contributor
- FSF Contributing Member
- Was founder of IPR-heavy company

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Hi, I'm Sam and I'll be talking again tomorrow about ENSIME so I shall keep it brief today.

Why am I talking about licencing? Well, I'm a Free Software Foundation Contributing Member and free / libre software is something that I feel passionately about.

Why should I be talking about this? I used to run a company that was very heavy on Intellectual Property Right (IPR) and in those years I had a lot of discussions with lawyers about copyright and licencing, including how we could use and distribute Free Software in our products and services. So I'm hopefully going to pass on what I learnt in this talk.

** Software Licence

Legal instrument governing *use* and *redistribution*

** Libre Software

- run the program as you wish, for any purpose

#+END_NOTES

** Open Source

- can view the source code
- no common rules for use / redistribution

** Example: NASA Open Source

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
Agreement.
#+END_QUOTE

- study how the program works, and change it ❌

Is it libre?

- run the program as you wish, for any purpose ✔
- study how the program works, and change it ✔
- redistribute copies ✔
- distribute copies of your modified versions to others ✔

-----

But you can sublicence or receive a modified version:

- run the program as you wish, for any purpose ❌
- study how the program works, and change it ❌
- redistribute copies ❌
- distribute copies of your modified versions to others ❌
- *Libre Software can become Proprietary*

** Example: JSON

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.
#+END_QUOTE

- run the program as you wish, for any purpose ❌
- Douglas Crockford, PayPal, can sue you for "Evil"
- *Not a Libre Software Licence*
- FSF, IBM, Google, Redhat all agree
- some companies consider it unenforceable
- don't try to be funny with your licence
- don't add restrictions ("no military use" was once popular)

* Copyright Transfer / Contributor Licence Agreement
** Copyright Transfer

- you give the copyright away
- you no longer have exclusive rights
- most employers require transfer
- some projects require transfer
    - they can relicence: selling exceptions
    - they can enforce violations (FSF's motivation)
    - http://gnu.org/philosophy/assigning-copyright.html

** Deutsches Urhebergesetz

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Do we have any Germans who can pronounce this for me?

In Germany...
#+END_NOTES

- cannot transfer status as a creator, nor complete rights
- "exclusive licences" achieve effective copyright transfer

** Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA)

- Copyright owner grants a special licence to one entity
- Be suspicious of projects where the CLA ≠ Licence
- Be very careful that you are not taking on liabilities

* Patents
** Patent

Exclusive rights granted to an inventor in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention.

- need a patent licence to run software that uses it
- run the program as you wish, for any purpose ❌
- GPL, LGPL, MPL, Apache include a patent licence
- MIT, BSD do not include a patent clause
- *prefer Apache 2.0 to BSD or MIT*

* Trademarks
** ®™

Recognisable symbol or name which identifies products or services of a particular source.

- Each Trademark comes with its own set of guidelines.
- Be very careful when using Trademarks.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We are happy for people to use derivations of it for their open source
projects and events. There's no official policy, just an informal "go
for it!" when anyone asks us.

- generous but *not a Libre Licence*
